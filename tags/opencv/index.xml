      <title>Removing Backscatter to Enhance the Visibility of Underwater Object</title>

      <description>This is a novel method based on underwater optical model for underwater object visibility enhancement based on single image.
General Schema For an underwater distorted image, it is firstly decomposed to reflectance and illuminance. Then color correction and dehazing methods are utilized to process each component separately, according to their specific features. Finally, we calculate the weights of two components and apply an efficient image fusion method to obtain the enhanced image.</description>

      <description>This paper &amp;ldquo;Enhancing Underwater Images and Videos by Fusion&amp;rdquo;, published by Ancuti et al. on CVPR, describes a novel strategy, built on the fusion principles, to enhance underwater videos and images. Here I implement this algorithm by Java, and summerize the main idea in this paper.
General Schema The enhancing approach starts from a single distorted underwater image, first of all, applying white balance to this image to generate the first input of fusion process, denotes as $img_{1}$, and applying a temporal coherent noise reduction method to this $img_{1}$ to derive another input of fusion process, denotes as $img_{2}$; then, obtaining the weights of these two inputs, where Laplacian contrast weight ($W_{L}$), local contrast weight ($W_{LC}$), Saliency weight ($W_{S}$) and exposedness weight ($W_{E}$) are used in this process; finally, the multi-scale fusion process is applied to generate the restored image.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Tone Mapping Technique for HDR Image and Java Implementation</title>
      <link>https://isaacchanghau.github.io/post/altm/</link>

      <description>This short paper, published by Ahn et al. on ICCE, introduces a new tone mapping technique for HDR images based on the retinex theory. Here I summarize this paper and show the Java implementation with OpenCV to realize the proposed algorithm.
Center/Surround Retinex The retinex theory, initially defined by Land et al., explains how the realiable color information from the real world is extracted by human visual system, and Jobson et al.</description>

      <description>As of OpenCV 2.4.4, OpenCV supports desktop Java development. Note that this post is transported from OpenCV Java Tutorials. This tutorial will help you install OpenCV on your desktop operating system.
Install the latest Java version Download the latest Java JDK from the Oracle website. Now you should be able to install the last Java JDK by open the file just downloaded.
Install the latest Eclipse version Download the latest Eclipse version at the Eclipse Download page choosing the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers version (suggested).</description>
